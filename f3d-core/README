The f3d suite: A portable version of SRI's Freedius / CME Image
Understanding environment.  This is a Lisp-based system that allows
users to view and manipulate geospatially-organized imagery and
geometry.  The core system provides representations for images, paged
(very large) images, and solid geometry situated in a common
coordinate system.

Explicit sensor models provide a variety of tools for image
registration and rendering in the presence of distortion and
unconventional imaging geometries.  These sensor models are supported
by CLOS-based math and transformation packages.  Transformations are
represented explicitly in terms of graphs that allow the user to
describe objects in object-centered coordinate systems that are
connected to other coordinate systems (e.g. sensor or geospatial).


f3d-core: Core transformation and image manipulation

f3d-geom: 2D and 3D object representation and OpenGL foreign function
interface.

f3d-tk: GUI backend supported by a Tcl/Tk foreign function interface.


== Windows ==

If you're on a Windows box, you will need to install the following -
Looks as if SBCL and Tcl/Tk will have to be 32-bit for now:

    Steel Bank Common Lisp  (Allegro 8.1 will probably work, but not >8.1)
    MinGW
    Cmake
    Tcl/Tk (32-bit version)
    Quicklisp

Nice to have: Emacs, svn



Here are the details:

o SBCL (1.1 or greater) - Download Windows binaries from 
          www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html

o MinGW - download the "latest version" from www.mingw.org.

  - Be sure to install C, C++, and MinGW Developer Toolkit.

  - Also be sure to add the MinGW / MSYS tools to your path, otherwise
cmake will not work.  F3D assumes "MSYS Makefiles" for cmake builds.
You are welcome to change this but at your own risk.  The paths to add
are:

         C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin

o Cmake 2.8 - Download from www.cmake.org.

o Tcl/Tk 8.6 - Download from Activestate.

o Quicklisp - download from quicklisp.org
